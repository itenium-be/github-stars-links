Github Stars
============

- each username/reponame only once!
- check that is not link to current page...


Add Github Stars shields to Github links.

Pay attention to:  
- Check if there already is a badge?
- Check if path is at raw.githubcontent? or at /tree/master/filename?
- also work with gists?
